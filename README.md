# Identical Sublime Text Monokai theme for Visual Studio Code

For C#, this theme is exactly the same Monokai's theme of Sublime Text but for Visual Studio Code instead. Unlike default C# VSCode's Monokai, this is an actual, perfect and identical copy of the loved by all Sublime Text's theme. It's name is **Sublime Monokai**.  

While I put special focus on making it identical specifically for C#, it is also close to identical in the case of C, C++ and Python. For other languages like Javascript, Ruby, Java, etc, it's not guaranteed to be 100% identical (or maybe yes, I didn't tested it), but it'll work anyway as just another Monokai theme :)

## Language's identicality support

*(yes, that's a made-up word)*
 
- **First class support *(100% identicality guaranteed)*:** C#.  
- **Second class support *(identical or close to identical, but not heavily tested)*:** C, C++, Python, PowerShell
- **Third class support *(it will work and should be similar, but wasn't developed or tested. Even if it's identical it wasn't on purpose)*:** Javascript, Ruby, Java, all others.

### Comparison between default VSCode Monokai theme and Sublime Text's

Observe the difference. It's subtle but it's there.

**Happy coding!** now with Monokai ;)
